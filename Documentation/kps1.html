    <div class="function">
    <h2>Point</h2>
    <p>Named tuple representing a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates.</p>
        </div>
    <h2>Functions:</h2>

    <h3>flipped(points)</h3>
    <p>
        This function takes a list of points and returns a new list where each point's y-coordinate is negated.
        It's used to transform points for intermediate calculations.
    </p>

    <h3>quickselect(ls, index, lo=0, hi=None, depth=0)</h3>
    <p>
        Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list.
        This implementation selects a pivot randomly and partitions the list around the pivot,
        narrowing down the search space recursively until the desired element is found.
        It's used in the algorithm for median finding and bridge computation.
    </p>

    <h3>bridge(points, vertical_line)</h3>
    <p>
        The bridge function finds the convex hull's bridge between two sets of points divided by a vertical line.
        It calculates the median slope of lines connecting pairs of points and uses this information to determine
        the leftmost and rightmost points that contribute to the bridge.
        This helps in dividing the problem of finding the convex hull recursively.
    </p>

    <h3>connect(lower, upper, points)</h3>
    <p>
        This function recursively connects the upper and lower hulls found by the bridge function.
        It takes the leftmost and rightmost points of the bridge along with the set of points and divides
        the points into two sets based on their position relative to the bridge.
        It then recursively connects the points on each side until the convex hull is formed.
    </p>

    <h3>upper_hull(points)</h3>
    <p>
        The upper_hull function finds the upper hull of the given set of points.
        It first identifies the leftmost and rightmost points, then selects all the points lying between them.
        Finally, it calls the connect function to connect these points and form the upper hull.
    </p>

    <h3>convex_hull(points)</h3>
    <p>
        This function combines the upper and lower hulls to form the complete convex hull.
        It takes the upper hull generated from the upper_hull function and the flipped version of the upper hull
        generated from the upper_hull function with flipped points.
        It concatenates these two hulls to create the final convex hull.
    </p>

    <h3>kirkpatrickseidel(a)</h3>
    <p>
        This is the main function implementing the Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm to find the convex hull.
        It takes a list of points, transforms them into Point objects, and then proceeds to find the convex hull
        using the aforementioned functions.
        The final convex hull is returned as a list of Point objects.
